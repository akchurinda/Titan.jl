# Automatic Differentiation

`Titan.jl` enables automatic differentiation in both forward (using [`ForwardDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl)) and reverse (using [`ReverseDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl)) modes by default. This feature allows users to seamlessly compute derivatives, gradients, and Hessians of model outputs with respect to input parameters, providing fast and efficient gradient-based structural design optimization and structural and system reliability analysis without relying on finite difference approximations.
